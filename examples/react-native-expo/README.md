# React Native Expo Example

This is an example project showcasing how to use React Native with Expo and Nhost.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhost/nhost
cd nhost/examples/react-native-expo
```

To get started run the command `nhost up`. This will start the Nhost backend and launch the Expo development server.

```bash
cd examples/react-native-expo
nhost up
```

Once the development server is running, you can use an iOS simulator or Android emulator to launch the app. We suggest to use the Expo app on your phone to scan the QR code and launch the app only if you changed to `NhostClient` to use your own, cloud-hosted Nhost project.

## Dependencies

This example project has the following dependencies:

- React Native
- Expo
- Nhost

Please refer to the documentation of each of these tools for more information on how to use them.
